# M5_accuracy
   Our data is from the Kaggle M5 Competition. We will use stats based algorithm like MA (Moving Average), EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) ,ARIMA(Auto Regression Integration Moving Average) 
   Machine learing algorithm like Xgboost, Adaboost,Lightgbm to predict the next 28-day period of Walmart sales using the sales records, price and calendar information. Because making accurate predictions for each product on single days is almost impossible, this project will optimize the accuracy for daily sales prediction.
