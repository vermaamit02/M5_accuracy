      Department stores like Walmart have uncountable product and money transactions every day. Because of their rapid transaction rates, keeping a balance between the inventory and customer demand is the most important decision for the managers. Therefore, making an accurate sales prediction for different products becomes an essential need for stores to optimize their profits. Most of the existing sales predictions only depend on extrapolating the statistical trend. The previous studies on market sales prediction require a lot of extra information like customer and product analysis. A more simplified model is needed by the department store to predict the product sales based on only the historical sales record. The new emerging machine learning methods enable us to make more accurate predictions like that. Our data is from the Kaggle M5 Competition. We will use stats based algorithm like MA (Moving Average), EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) ,ARIMA(Auto Regression Integration Moving Average) and Machine learing algorithm like Xgboost, Adaboost,Lightgbm to predict the next 28-day period of Walmart sales using the sales records, price and calendar information. Because making accurate predictions for each product on single days is almost impossible, this project will optimize the accuracy for daily sales prediction.
